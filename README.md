# TimeyWimey
No more stuggle with time zones... Thanks Discord!

TimeyWimey allows you to ask stuff like
`#timefor @user`
and
`#timeat 8PM @user` (Buggy. See [here](https://play.golang.org/p/_mnELD1nCv) for details. It's very weird)

First you need to set your timezone
do that using **for example**
`#timezone europe/sweden`

## Have fun!
